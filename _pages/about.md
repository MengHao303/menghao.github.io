I am a fourth-year Ph.D student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering in Nanyang Technological University under the supervision of [Prof. Liu Yang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/).
My Ph.D works mainly center around building tools for detecting software vulnerabilities, including the Fuzz Driver Generation, Firmware Rehosting, and Binary Instrumentation.
They worked by enabling the fuzz testing on the targets that cannot be effectively applied before.
In the near future, I plan to explore more possibilities on vulnerability detection, such as modeling new kinds of vulnerbilities, exploring LLM-assisted approaches, etc.
In the long run, I'm eager to build more cool things!
Currently, I am a Research Associate in [CYSREN@NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/cysren) since March 2023, and also working as Project Co-Investigator for some projects.
